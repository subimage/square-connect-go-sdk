# **CreateRefund**
> V1Refund CreateRefund(ctx, body, locationId)
CreateRefund

Issues a refund for a previously processed payment. You must issue a refund within 60 days of the associated payment.  You cannot issue a partial refund for a split tender payment. You must instead issue a full or partial refund for a particular tender, by providing the applicable tender id to the V1CreateRefund endpoint. Issuing a full refund for a split tender payment refunds all tenders associated with the payment.  Issuing a refund for a card payment is not reversible. For development purposes, you can create fake cash payments in Square Point of Sale and refund them.

# **ListPayments**
> []V1Payment ListPayments(ctx, locationId, optional)
ListPayments

Provides summary information for all payments taken for a given Square account during a date range. Date ranges cannot exceed 1 year in length. See Date ranges for details of inclusive and exclusive dates.  *Note**: Details for payments processed with Square Point of Sale while in offline mode may not be transmitted to Square for up to 72 hours. Offline payments have a `created_at` value that reflects the time the payment was originally processed, not the time it was subsequently transmitted to Square. Consequently, the ListPayments endpoint might list an offline payment chronologically between online payments that were seen in a previous request.

------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **ctx** | **context.Context** | context for authentication, logging, cancellation, deadlines, tracing, etc.

 **endTime** | **optional.String**| The end of the requested reporting period, in ISO 8601 format. If this value is more than one year greater than begin_time, this endpoint returns an error. Default value: The current time. |

# **RetrieveSettlement**
> V1Settlement RetrieveSettlement(ctx, locationId, settlementId)
RetrieveSettlement

Provides comprehensive information for a single settlement.  The returned `Settlement` objects include an `entries` field that lists the transactions that contribute to the settlement total. Most settlement entries correspond to a payment payout, but settlement entries are also generated for less common events, like refunds, manual adjustments, or chargeback holds.  Square initiates its regular deposits as indicated in the [Deposit Options with Square](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/3807) help article. Details for a regular deposit are usually not available from Connect API endpoints before 10 p.m. PST the same day.  Square does not know when an initiated settlement **completes**, only whether it has failed. A completed settlement is typically reflected in a bank account within 3 business days, but in exceptional cases it may take longer.

### Required Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **ctx** | **context.Context** | context for authentication, logging, cancellation, deadlines, tracing, etc.
  **locationId** | **string**| The ID of the settlements&#x27;s associated location. | 
  **settlementId** | **string**| The settlement&#x27;s Square-issued ID. You obtain this value from Settlement objects returned by the List Settlements endpoint. | 

### Return type

[**V1Settlement**](V1Settlement.md)

### Authorization

[oauth2](../README.md#oauth2)

### HTTP request headers

 - **Content-Type**: Not defined
 - **Accept**: application/json
